I am a Wireless Systems Design Engineer at Cisco Systems, where I bridge research and product development in the wireless enterprise access point department. My work blends theoretical research with practical implementation, solving real-world challenges in wireless communications.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2022, and my M.Sc. in the same field from the same institution in 2019. Prior to joining Cisco, I worked as a research assistant focusing on large-scale optimization techniques applied to wireless communications.

My research has been published in leading journals such as the *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing*, and my contributions at Cisco include innovations in indoor localization of access points, indoor navigation for mobile devices, and asset tracking. I have been recognized as a “Wireless Star” at Cisco Systems for my impactful work.

I am passionate about applying signal processing and optimization methods to real-world wireless system challenges.
