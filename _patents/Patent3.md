## Abstract
Described herein are devices, systems, methods, and processes for estimating the geolocation of network devices by jointly utilizing pseudorange measurements from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) satellites and terrestrial-based ranging measurements between network devices. Each network device is equipped with a GNSS receiver that collects pseudorange data from each satellite link at time intervals. Terrestrial-based ranging measurements between network devices can also be collected. The receiver clock error can be accounted for at least in part by over-the-air time synchronization of network devices. To mitigate the impact of multipath and improve accuracy, pseudorange measurements with less than satisfactory quality metrics can be filtered out. In some embodiments, the geolocation of anchor network devices can be estimated with high accuracy first, and then the rest of the non-anchor network devices may be localized in a second-stage localization process.
