## Abstract
Enhancing Multi-Access Point (AP) Coordination (MAPC) null-steering may be provided. Enhancing null-steering may include sending a coordination request for MAPC. A coordination response may be received from one or more APs. A Channel State Information (CSI) request may then be sent. CSI of one or more clients associated with the one or more APs may be received. Next, one or more precoder and decoder matrices may be determined based on the CSI of the one or more clients. The one or more precoder matrices may be sent to the one or more APs, and the one or more decoder matrices may be sent to the one or more clients. A transmission may be sent to a first client using null-steering and interference alignment based on the one or more precoder matrices, wherein the transmitting is synchronized with transmissions by the one or more APs to the one or more clients.
