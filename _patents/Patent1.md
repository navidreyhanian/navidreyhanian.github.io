## Abstract
Described herein are devices, systems, methods, and processes for managing the computational complexity in geolocating a large number of network devices (e.g., access points (APs)) in indoor environments. A number of network devices may be partitioned into smaller groups or batches based on neighbor knowledge about the network devices. Each batch of network devices can include just devices located on a same floor, or may include devices located across different floors. Every batch may include at least one anchor network device. The geolocation of the network devices can be determined, batch-by-batch, based on fusing global navigation satellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements and inter-network device ranging measurements. The geolocation accuracy for each partition can be evaluated utilizing such metrics as the average residual error. If the error for a batch is greater than a threshold, remedial measures may be taken to reduce the error and improve the geolocation accuracy.
